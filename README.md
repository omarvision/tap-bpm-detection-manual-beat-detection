# tap-bpm-detection-manual-beat-detection
If you have a waveform in Unity that is a song and want to know how many beats per minute (bpm) the song is, you can figure it out by tapping the beats while you listen to the song playback. This unity tutorial goes over how to tap the beats to a playing song and get the beats per minute (bpm) that the song is playing at.  I call this manual beat detection because you (the user) has to tap the beats to get the bpm.
